## Background
I was advised by Dr. Junyuan Lin to work on the sequntial optimization of the 1/2 approximation path cover algorithm, and the project was used to compute the primary algorithm and optimized algorithm on Watts-Strogatz graph and Erdos-Renyi graph with different nodes number. The project is written in python, and the main data structure is dictionary due to its low time complexity to sort. The paper has been published on arxiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08947.pdf
